## Style Guidelines

- Wrap lines at 80 characters for Markdown and JavaScript files.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.

## Testing

- Run `npm test` before committing. The command currently reports missing
  scripts, which is acceptable until tests exist.

## Documentation

- Update the README when you add or change major features.
