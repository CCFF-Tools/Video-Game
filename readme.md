# Loopstack: Escape from Alden Labs

A browser-based surrealist sci-fi platformer concept. Play as Juno, a junior
archivist navigating a glitching research facility fragmented across time and
media. Use temporal jumps, format shifts, caption platforms, and cold storage
combat to rebuild the original timeline.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser or serve it with a local static
   server.
3. Use the arrow keys to move and jump. Press 1-4 to switch format modes.

## Features

- Side-view movement with jumping and collision.
- Layered backgrounds with parallax depth.
- Basic physics including gravity, friction, and camera follow.
- Format modes (Betamax, 8mm, MPEG2, MiniDV) with unique filters,
  physics tweaks, and reskinned art.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – entry point for the game.
- `main.js` – main game logic and prototype scene.
- `config.js` – configuration settings.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Before submitting, run `npm test` to execute any
